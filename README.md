# COMP-3610---Renewable-Energy-Prediction

# Predicting Renewable Energy Output Using Weather and Historical Data

This project aims to predict renewable energy output (solar and wind) using historical energy production data and weather forecasts. The goal is to improve energy grid management and support the transition to sustainable energy sources.

## Problem Statement
Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are highly dependent on weather conditions, making their output unpredictable. This unpredictability poses challenges for energy grid management and integration into the power supply. Our project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict renewable energy output using historical energy production data, weather forecasts, and external factors like energy demand.

## Project Goals
- Develop a predictive model for renewable energy output (solar and wind).
- Create an interactive dashboard to visualize predictions.
- Provide recommendations for optimizing renewable energy integration into the power grid.

## Data Sources
- **Energy Data**: Historical energy generation data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Weather Data**: Weather forecasts and historical weather data from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), and [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/).
